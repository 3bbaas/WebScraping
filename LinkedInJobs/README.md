# What this project does
## Login Stage
we first login LinkedIn with our email and password.
## Search Stage
First you specify what you are up to search for 
```target = input("Search:")```

Then specify the number of pages you want to search on 
```numOfPages = 3``` 
(the more pages, the more results),
But the more pages also means more CPU power usage.

## Storing Stage
Once we search on the number of pages we specified, all the urls will be sent to a csv file and stored.
